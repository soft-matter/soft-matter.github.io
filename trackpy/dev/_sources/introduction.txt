Introduction to Trackpy
-----------------------

Trackpy is a package for finding blob-like features in video, tracking them
through time,  and analyzing their trajectories. It implements and extends the
widely-used Crocker--Grier algorithm in Python.

There are many similar projects. (See table below.)
Our implementation is distinguished by succinct and flexible usage,
a thorough testing framework ensuring code stability and accuracy,
scalability, and thorough documentation.

Several researchers have merged their independent efforts into this code.
We would like to see others in the community adopt it and potentially
contribute code to it.

Features
^^^^^^^^

Basics
""""""

  * The `widely-used particle tracking algorithm <http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/idl/tracking.html>`__
    originally implemented by John Crocker and Eric Weeks in IDL is reimplemented
    in Python. Wherever possible, existing tools from widely-used Python modules
    are employed.
  * This reimplemention is full-featured, including subpixel precision
    verified with test cases.
  * The module is actively used and tested on **Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux**,
    and it uses only free, open-source software.
  * Frames of video can be loaded from a **video file (AVI, MOV, etc.), a**
    **multi-frame TIFF, or a directory of sequential images (TIFF,
    PNG, JPG, etc.)**.
  * Results are given as DataFrames, high-performance spreadsheet-like objects
    from `Python pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/overview.html>`__
    which can easily be saved to a **CSV file, Excel spreadsheet,
    SQL database, HDF5 file**, and more.
  * Particle trajectories can be
    characterized, grouped, and plotted using a suite of convenient functions.
  * To verify correctness and stability, a **suite of 150+ tests reproduces
    basic results**.

Special Capabilities
""""""""""""""""""""

  * Both feature-finding and trajectory-linking can be performed on
    **arbitrarily long videos** using a fixed, modest amount of memory. (Results
    can be read and saved to disk throughout.)
  * A **prediction framework** helps track particles in fluid flows,
    or other scenarios where velocity is correlated between time steps.
  * Feature-finding and trajectory-linking works on **images with any number of dimensions**,
    making possible some creative applications.
  * **Uncertainty is estimated** following a method `described in this paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.042457>`__ by Savin and Doyle.
  * **High-performance** components (numba acceleration and FFTW support) are used only if
    if available. Since these can be tricky to install on some machines,
    the code will automatically fall back on slower pure Python implementations
  * **Adaptive search** can prevent the tracking algorithm from failing
    or becoming too slow, by automatically making adjustments when needed.
