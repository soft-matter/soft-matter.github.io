Introduction to Trackpy
-----------------------

Trackpy is a package for tracking blob-like features in video images, following them
through time, and analyzing their trajectories. It started from a Python implementation
of the widely-used Crocker--Grier algorithm and is currently in transition
towards a general-purpose Python tracking library.

There are many similar projects. (See table below.)
Our implementation is distinguished by succinct and flexible usage,
a thorough testing framework ensuring code stability and accuracy,
scalability, and thorough documentation.

Several researchers have merged their independent efforts into this code.
We would like to see others in the community adopt it and potentially
contribute code to it.

Features
^^^^^^^^

Basics
""""""
Following the `widely-used particle tracking algorithm <http://www.physics.emory.edu/~weeks/idl/tracking.html>`__,
we separate *tracking* into three separate steps. In the first step, *feature finding*
initial feature coordinates are obtained from the images. Subsequently, sub-pixel precision
is obtained in coordinate *refinement*. Finally, the coordaintes are *linked* in time yielding
the feature trajectories.

  * The tracking algorithm originally implemented by John Crocker and Eric Weeks in IDL was
    completely reimplemented in Python.
  * A `flexible framework for least-squares fitting <https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.08819>`__
    allows for sub-pixel refinement using any radial model function in 2D and 3D.
  * Trackpy is actively used and tested on **Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux**,
    and it uses only **free, open-source** software.
  * Frames of video are loaded via the sister project `PIMS <http://github.com/soft-matter/pims>`__
    which enables reading of several types of **video files (AVI, MOV, etc.),
    specialized formats (LEI, ND2, SEQ, CINE), multi-frame TIFF, or a directory of sequential
    images (TIFF, PNG, JPG, etc.)**.
  * Results are given as DataFrames, high-performance spreadsheet-like objects
    from `Python pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/overview.html>`__
    which can easily be saved to a **CSV file, Excel spreadsheet,
    SQL database, HDF5 file**, and more.
  * Particle trajectories can be
    characterized, grouped, and plotted using a suite of convenient functions.
  * To verify correctness and stability, a **suite of 500+ tests verifies basic results
    on each trackpy update**.

Special Capabilities
""""""""""""""""""""

  * Both feature-finding and trajectory-linking can be performed on
    **arbitrarily long videos** using a fixed, modest amount of memory. (Results
    can be read and saved to disk throughout.)
  * A **prediction framework** helps track particles in fluid flows,
    or other scenarios where velocity is correlated between time steps.
  * Feature-finding optionally makes use of the **history of feature coordinates**
    in a routine that combines linking and feature-finding.
  * Feature-finding and trajectory-linking works on **images with any number of dimensions**,
    making possible some creative applications.
  * **Uncertainty is estimated** following a method `described in this paper <http://dx.doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.042457>`__ by Savin and Doyle.
  * **High-performance** numba acceleration is used only if
    if available. Since these can be tricky to install on some machines,
    the code will automatically fall back on slower pure Python implementations
  * **Adaptive search** can prevent the tracking algorithm from failing
    or becoming too slow, by automatically making adjustments when needed.
