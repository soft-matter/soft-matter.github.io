Video
=====

PIMS provides reading of video through :ref:`video-pyav`,
:ref:`ImageIO <video-imageio-moviepy>`
or :ref:`MoviePy <video-imageio-moviepy>`.

PyAV (fastest)
--------------


`PyAV <http://mikeboers.github.io/PyAV/>`_ can be installed via Anaconda, as follows:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda install av -c conda-forge

Non-anaconda users will have to compile PyAV themselves, which is complicated,
especially on Windows. For this we refer the
users to the `PyAV documentation <https://mikeboers.github.io/PyAV/>`_.

There are two ways PIMS provides random access to video files, which is not
something that video formats natively support:

* :class:`PyAVReaderTimed <pims.PyAVReaderTimed>` bases the indices of the video frames on the
  ``frame_rate`` that is reported by the video file, along with the timestamps
  that are imprinted on the separate video frames. The readers ``PyAVVideoReader``
  and ``Video`` are different names for this reader.
* :class:`PyAVReaderIndexed <pims.PyAVReaderIndexed>` scans through the entire video to build a table
  of contents. This means that opening the file can take some time, but
  once it is open, random access is fast. In the case timestamps or `frame_rate``
  are not available, this reader is the preferred option.

ImageIO and MoviePy
-------------------
Both `ImageIO <https://imageio.github.io>`_ and `MoviePy <http://zulko.github.io/moviepy>`_
implement interfaces with ffmpeg through a Pipe. These are implemented through
:class:`ImageIOReader <pims.ImageIOReader>` and :class:`MoviePyReader <pims.MoviePyReader>`, respectively.

.. The import of pims.moviepy_reader fails. MoviePy seems to use imageio in turn.
