PIMS: Python Image Sequence
===========================

PIMS is a lazy-loading interface to sequential data with numpy-like slicing.

Key features:

* One consistent interface to many file formats
* Numpy-like slicing returns lazy-loading, iterable, sliceable objects

Example
-------

Load a sequence of images from a directory, where the images are named
:file:`img-0.png`, :file:`img-1.png`, etc.

.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   from pims.tests.test_common import save_dummy_png, clean_dummy_png
   filenames = ['img-{0}.png'.format(i) for i in range(9)]
   save_dummy_png('.', filenames, (256, 256))

.. ipython:: python

   from pims import ImageSequence
   images = ImageSequence('img-*.png')
   images

Images can be randomly accessed with standard Python slicing syntax.

.. ipython:: python

   images[0]  # first image
   images[-5]  # fifth from the end

The images are iterable. Data is loaded one image at a time, conserving
memory.

.. ipython:: python

   import numpy as np
   for image in images:
       np.sum(image)  # do something

Slicing ``images`` returns another lazy-loading object that is also iterable
and sliceable.

.. ipython:: python

   subsection = images[:5]  # the first five images
   len(images)
   len(subsection)
   for image in subsection:
       np.sum(image)  # do something

   subsubsection = subsection[::2]  # every other of the first five images

Fancy numpy-like slicing is supported.

.. ipython:: python

   subsection2 = images[[0, 3, 7]]
   mask = [True, False, False, False, False, True, False, False, False, False]
   subsection3 = images[mask]


.. ipython:: python
   :suppress:

   clean_dummy_png('.', filenames)
