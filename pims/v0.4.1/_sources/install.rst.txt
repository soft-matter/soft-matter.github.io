.. note::

   To get started with Python on any platform, download and install
   `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_.
   It comes with the common scientific Python packages built in.

With `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/>`_ 
(or `Miniconda <http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html>`_) installed,
type the following into a Terminal to install PIMS. That's "Terminal" on a Mac,
and "Start > Applications > Command Prompt" on Windows. Type these lines:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge pims

The above installs the latest stable release. Finally, to try it out, type:

.. code-block:: bash

    ipython notebook
